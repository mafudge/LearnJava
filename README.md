# LearnJava 

This repository contains code samples and exercises to support the **Learn to Program in Java** video series.

[Here's a link to the series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRiRUsTyUXhUXoOPEdMZWhGpGeSQFZgH)

There are 20 lessons total, each in a separate folder.

Each lesson folder contains:
- The source code which was written during the video lesson, so you can run the examples on your own.
- Code exercises, so you can practice programming and debugging code, specifically:
  - One **DebugThis!** exercise where you fix problems with a broken program.
  - Two **Challenge Activities** where you write a portion of code to complete a larger program. 
- The solutions to the code exercises, in case you get stuck and need to peek at the answers.

To follow along with the lessons, you'll need to install NetBeans 8. You can download it here:
