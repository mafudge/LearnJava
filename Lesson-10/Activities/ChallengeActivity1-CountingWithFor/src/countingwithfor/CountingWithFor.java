/** Challenge Activity 1 - Counting with a for loop
 * 
 * In this activity you will use a for loop to roll a die 5000 times and count
 * the number of times a 1 comes up on the die. This is a fairly common practice 
 * in "data processing" style computer programs.
 * 
 * Do this 5000 times
 *  roll a die
 *  if it comes up 1 then increase the count
 * 
 * After the loop is over display the number of rolls, count of 1's and 
 * percentage of rolls which came up 1. (Should be close to 0.167)
 * 
 * Make sure to "block out" your code correctly. 
 * Sloppy code is as bad as incorrect code!
 * 
 * SAMPLE RUN:
 *
